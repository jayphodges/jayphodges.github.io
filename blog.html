      <h2>My Mod1 Experience at Turing:<h2>
      <p>
        I have to admit that my first module at Turing turned out to be an interesting one. To begin with I was not entirely sure what I challenges I would be presented with. I have a technical background, so I have been through a number of challenging courses and impossible deadlines, which I was hoping would help me in my Turing journey. It did, but suffice to say that the breadth of work was still amazing. The amount of development that occurred in only 6 weeks continues to surprise me. I had started out with only the most basic understanding of programming, and now I feel as though I am building a strong basis for a future career in programming. I look forward to see what is coming in module 2, and I now there will continue to be more and more challenges.

      <h2>Favorite Technical Concept:<h2>
      <p>
        So far as programming goes, the most interesting concept I have seen so far was recursive functions. They are initially difficult to wrap your head around, but they functions they are able to complete are compelling. So far as my favorite technical concept in general still, Iâ€™ll have to pull from my prior career. I have always found the variety of modulation techniques used in communication fascinating. From the simple things we have all at least heard of, such as AM (amplitude modulation) and FM (frequency modulation) to the more complex ones that are more often in use on modern communication, phase shift keying. That is where the change occurring is the phase is changing directions, with the direction of the shift encodes the information.
